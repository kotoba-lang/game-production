  "The gameSpec vocabulary — reading and validating a game's design as data.

  A gameSpec is the whole design of one game expressed as a datom set: scene,
  player baseline, weapons, passives, enemies, bosses with phase-gated
  movesets, waves, xp and coop rules. The runtime is shared; the spec is what
  makes one game different from another.

  Two properties this namespace exists to protect, both learned from the
  survivors specs rather than invented:

  1. **Every numeric is an integer.** ms, px, px/s and permille are the only
     units, so a fractional literal is a design error the reader can catch —
     not a rounding difference that shows up as drift between the balance
     analysis here and the fixed-point runtime that actually plays the game.

  2. **Ids are references.** `:weapon/evolves-to`, `:weapon/merge-passive`,
     `:move/summon-id` and the coop synergy pairs all name another entity by
     id. A typo in one of them does not fail at read time — it fails as a
     weapon that never evolves, or a boss move that summons nothing, which is
     invisible until someone plays for five minutes. They are checked here.

  Pure: no IO, no generation, no runtime. Work-independent, per ADR-2607023000
  (the craft layer holds vocabulary; the -ka repo holds the business).")
